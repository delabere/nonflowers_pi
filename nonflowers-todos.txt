# run to get selenium and latest webdriver
pip3 install selenium
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver  # could be worth trying different browsers

# need to create a quick python script to test selenium headless
1. grab a page
2. print something out to screen


Things to do:
SETUP & TESTING
[x] install raspbian
[x] update pi
[x] put a nonflowers image on the pi
[x] install inky python library on pi (& python if needed)
[x] install other inky library
[x] enable SPI
[x] test eink display with inky library
[ ] install software to run wittypi3
[ ] create python script to wipe screen and load image
[ ] configure / test wittypi & inky interaction
  - [ ] run inkypi with wittypi3 plugged inky
  - [ ] run wittypi3 with inky plugged in

FEASABILITY
[x] test script through pi and see if it has the power
if it has the power:
  [x] create selenium script to grab image on desktop to confirm it works
otherwise:
  [-] modify non-flowers to run locally using node & save down image
  [-] see if pi has the power to run it locally


DEPLOYMENT  
[ ] create image script (get image, edit image, show on screen, shutdown pi)
  - [x] get image
  - [x] edit image
  - [ ] display image
[ ] create startup kickoff script (will trigger image script)
[ ] configure script to run on boot - https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-program-on-startup/all
[ ] configure wittypi3 to auto boot once daily
[ ] figure out how to run this on battery / powerbank

AESTHETICS
[ ] put the project into a photo frame
