# run to get selenium and latest webdriver
pip3 install selenium
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver  # could be worth trying different browsers

# need to create a quick python script to test selenium headless
1. grab a page
2. print something out to screen


Things to do:
SETUP & TESTING
[x] install raspbian
[ ] update pi
[ ] put a nonflowers image on the pi
[ ] install inky library on pi (& python if needed)
[ ] test eink display with inky library
[ ] install software to run wittypi3
[ ] create python script to wipe screen and load image
[ ] configure / test wittypi & inky interaction
  - [ ] run inkypi with wittypi3 plugged inky
  - [ ] run wittypi3 with inky plugged in

FEASABILITY
[ ] test script through pi and see if it has the power
if it has the power:
  [ ] create selenium script to grab image on desktop to confirm it works
otherwise:
  [ ] modify non-flowers to run locally using node & save down image
  [ ] see if pi has the power to run it locally


DEPLOYMENT  
[ ] create image script (get image, show on screen, shutdown pi)
[ ] create startup kickoff script (will trigger image script)
[ ] configure wittypi3 to auto boot once daily
[ ] figure out how to run this on battery / powerbank

AESTHETICS
[ ] put the project into a photo frame
